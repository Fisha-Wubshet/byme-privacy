Privacy Policy  
----------------

### Introduction  
Our privacy policy explains what information ByMe Driver collects, how we use it, and the choices you have. ByMe Driver, built by Go Tech, is a free app designed for use by our partnered drivers. By using ByMe Driver, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. The personal information we collect allows us to provide and improve the service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, available on our website, unless otherwise defined here.



### Information Collection and Use  
To provide a smooth experience, we may request certain personal information, including your name, email address, gender, location (with your permission), and profile picture. This information is retained by us and used as described in this policy.

The app also uses third-party services that may collect data that could be used to identify you. We will be transparent about these services and the data they collect in future updates to this policy.



### Cookies  
ByMe Driver does not directly use cookies, which are small data files used to identify your device. However, some third-party libraries and code within the app may use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You can choose to accept or refuse these cookies and be notified when a cookie is sent to your device. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of the app.



### Location Information  
The ByMe Driver app uses location permissions in the background. This is because the app is designed for our partnered drivers, and location data is essential for features like:

* Tracking delivery status
* Enabling fleet management
We only access your location when you are using the app to track the delivery process and ensure smooth operations.


### Device Information  
We collect some non-personally identifiable information from your device. This information helps us provide better service, prevent fraudulent activities, and improve the app's overall functionality.

### Service Providers  
We may employ third-party companies and individuals to:

* Facilitate our service
* Provide specific services on our behalf
* Analyze how our service is used

These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. They are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.


### Security  
We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over  the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.  

### Changes to This Privacy Policy  
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
